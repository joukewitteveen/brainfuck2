Brainfuck 2
===========

This is an interpreter for a brainfuck dialect. Notable design choices are
the unbounded size of the data array (both to the left and to the right) and
the addition of the '2' command, which doubles the number executions of the
previous command as follows:

    +22+2	adds 10: (((1 * 2) * 2) + 1) * 2

Whitespace is ignored and characters not among <>+-,.2[] have the effect
that from that character on, the rest of the line is ignored (treated as
comments). Syntactical errors are fatal.

By the addition of the '2' command, programs can potentially get a lot
shorter.

[>+2+2+>+22+2>+2+>+<22-]>+2.>+.+2+2+.2+2+.>+2.<2+2222-.>.+2+.-2-2.-222.>+.>.

Incidentally, the original brainfuck was conceived 20 years before
brainfuck2. Hooray!
